# 👋 Hi, I’m Venkateswarareddy Dundi

🎯 I’m a data engineering enthusiast with a strong foundation in building scalable ETL pipelines and developing modern data warehouse solutions.

🚀 I’m passionate about transforming raw, fragmented data into structured, insightful, and analytics-ready assets using best practices in data modeling, pipeline orchestration, and data quality management.

🔧 My experience spans:
- Data Warehousing with **SQL Server** and dimensional modeling
- Developing ETL pipelines using **Python (Pandas, pyodbc, requests)** and **Apache Airflow**
- Data ingestion from **APIs, flat files, and web sources**
- Cleansing and transforming data across **bronze, silver, and gold layers**
- Enabling reporting through **Power BI**, Excel, and structured SQL views

🌱 Currently expanding my expertise in:
- Cloud data platforms (Azure Data Factory, Synapse)
- Real-time data processing
- Airflow 3.0 orchestration and SCD implementation

🤝 Open to collaborations on projects involving:
- Data Engineering & Automation
- Scalable ETL Frameworks
